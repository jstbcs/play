This repository contains (mostly R) code for little toy projects I started for fun. Its purpose is questionable (mainly sharing code for plots is posted on twitter).

## sexual harassment spreadsheet
I took a quick look at this spreadsheet where people shared their experience with sexual harassment in academia: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S9KShDLvU7C-KkgEevYTHXr3F6InTenrBsS9yk-8C5M/edit#gid=1530077352

Too frustrating. I quit after plotting the consequences for the harasser.
